# Button

To implement Button component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@kiwicom/orbit-react-native';
```

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```jsx
<Button>Hello World!</Button>
```

## Props

## Functional specs

- When the `external` is specified, `noopener` and `noreferrer` values will automatically added to attribute `rel` for security reason.

- By passing the `href` prop into Button, it will render into `a` element. If you pass `component` prop it will override this logic.

- If you want to render **Icon only Button**, you just need to let `children` prop empty and set up any `icon` you want to use.

- If you want to use the `component` prop then **YourComponent** should accept at least `className`. Otherwise it won't be rendered with proper styling, e.g.:

  ```jsx
  const YourComponent = props => <div {...props} />

  <Button component={YourComponent}>Title</Button>
  ```

  If you specify the children of **YourComponent** component, it will override the children prop of Button component, e.g.:

  ```jsx
  const YourComponent = props => <div {...props}>YourComponent</div>;
  ```

## Accessibility

A button is mainly used for indicating an action, submitting a data, opening a modal etc. If you want to use Button for navigation consider using a `<TextLink>` for that.

- Use `ariaControls` prop to add `aria-controls` attribute to establish the relationship between button and element which is controlled by it. `aria-controls` works only with a unique `id` of an element.

- Use `ariaExpands` prop to add `aria-expands` to indicate screenreaders, that element controlled by button through `ariaControls` is expanded or not.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that button is inactive and they can't interact with it.

- Use `role` and `tabIndex` when you are rendering `Button` to non-actionable HTML element as `div` or `span`. However, this should be done only in edge-cases as it is anti-pattern behavior.

- Use `title` to add `aria-label` when you need to add extra informations to screen readers or there is no `children` presented to be used as label.
