# `generateStyles()` and `useStyles()`

Here is a quick explanation how styles are written and generated in ORN:

Let's take the `Text` component as an example.
It uses a React Hook called `useStyles()`:

```js
const styles = useStyles({
  base: 'text',
  colorText: type,
  fontSizeText: size,
  fontWeight: weight,
  align,
  spaceAfter,
  uppercase,
  italic,
});
```

What the Hook does, is it takes each of the properties and converts them into strings, like this:

`base: 'text'` -> `base_text`
`fontSizeText: size` -> `fontsizetext_${size.toLowerCase()}`
etc.

The style order is important, for example:

```js
const styles = useStyles({
  base: 'text',
  colorText: type,
```

If in `base` style will be define text color style, the `colorText` style will overide that color style.

So now we have a list of StyleSheet IDs, that we return as an Array, and then we can pass them to `style={}` on the RN component.
All of these are pre-generated in the ThemeProvider.

If you look at `src/styles/generateStyles.js`, you see three sections:

- The first one will set up mappings and automatically generate some repetitive code, if there are orbit tokens available
  for example:

```js
widthIcon: {
  property: 'fontSize',
  types: ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'],
  transform: parseFloat,
},
```

This is the equivalent of:

```js
rules.fontsize_small = { fontSize: parseFloat(theme.orbit.widthIconSmall) };
rules.fontsize_medium = { fontSize: parseFloat(theme.orbit.widthIconMedium) };
rules.fontsize_large = { fontSize: parseFloat(theme.orbit.widthIconLarge) };
```

- The second section in this file contains rules that would have been harder to map programmatically than just to write them out (KISS).
  Normally, only generic rules should go here, that are used in multiple components.

- The third section in this file loads all the manually exported component-specific files, that are re-exported from `src/styles/componentStyles.js`,
  If we go back to `src/Text/Text.styles.js`, you see that `base_text` and `fontsizetext_small` are defined there.
